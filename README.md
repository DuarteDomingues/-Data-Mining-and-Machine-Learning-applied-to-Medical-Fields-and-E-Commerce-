# -Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-applied-to-Medical-Fields-and-E-Commerce-
 Data Mining and Machine learnining project to help prescribe the best lenses to a patient based on a variety of parameters, and classify mushrooms and edible or not. Also the extraction of data of an E-Commerce group. 


### Final project of the course ES (Engenharia de Software)

Mestrado Engenharia Informática e Multimédia - ISEL

The first part of the project is the prescription of lenses to a patient based on medical data of the pacient. Also classifying mushrooms as edible or not based on different parameters.

* SQL was used to create the databases.
* Orange data-mining framework was used to analyse and visualize information about the data.
* Python was used for data processing and classification and algorithms like 1R, ID3 and Naive Bayes.

The second part of the project is based on processing and extracting information from an E-Commerce database. 

* Processing and sorting the data with SQL.
* Development of a Basket Analysis of the data to find strong association rules.
* Orange data-mining framework was used to analyse and visualize information about the data.
